## Inspiration

Spending money in Rwanda is incredibly easy, thanks to seamless payment services like MoMo. When I first arrived in Rwanda, I found myself spending constantlyâ€”with no structured way to save. It felt as if my expenses were automated, but my savings werenâ€™t.

I wanted to build healthy financial habits, but I couldnâ€™t find a tool that made saving just as effortless as spending. This realization sparked the idea for **Zidify**â€”a smart, automated savings platform designed to empower young people to take control of their financial future with ease.

## What I Learned

Building Zidify taught me that financial literacy isnâ€™t just about knowing how to saveâ€”itâ€™s about making saving effortless and rewarding. Many young people struggle not because they donâ€™t want to save, but because they lack the right tools. Through Zidify, Iâ€™ve explored the power of **AI-driven robo-advisory** to personalize financial guidance, making wealth-building accessible and intuitive.

## Development Process

Zidify was designed with three core principles in mind:

1. **Automation** â€“ Making saving as seamless as spending.
2. **Personalization** â€“ Using AI to offer tailored financial insights.
3. **Accessibility** â€“ Ensuring an intuitive and mobile-first experience.

I focused on integrating AI-powered robo-advisory to help users make smart financial decisions effortlessly. By combining automated savings with intelligent recommendations, Zidify transforms the way young Rwandans approach wealth-building.

## Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges was designing a system that balances **flexibility and discipline**â€”allowing users to set their savings goals while ensuring they stay committed. Another hurdle was **financial education**â€”making complex financial concepts digestible for young users who may be new to saving and investing.

Despite these challenges, Zidify represents a step toward a financially empowered generationâ€”one where saving is no longer an afterthought but an intuitive, automated habit.

## What's Next for Zidify

The journey doesnâ€™t stop here. Zidify is evolving to become a **comprehensive financial companion** for young people. The next steps include:

- **Expanding AI capabilities** â€“ Enhancing robo-advisory to offer more advanced financial insights.
- **Introducing investment options** â€“ Helping users grow their wealth beyond saving.
- **Gamified financial education** â€“ Making learning about money engaging and rewarding.
- **Strategic partnerships** â€“ Collaborating with financial institutions to offer better incentives for savers.

Ultimately, Zidify aims to **make wealth-building a lifestyle**, ensuring every young Rwandan has the tools to achieve financial freedom. ðŸš€
